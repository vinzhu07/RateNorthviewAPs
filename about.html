                Hello Northview, my name is Ian Yang,

                and my name is Vincent Zhu, and we are graduates from the class of 2020 and soon-to-be freshmen at
                Georgia
                Tech. </br></br>

                Have you ever struggled to decide which AP course to take? Do I take AP Chem or AP Bio? AB Calc or BC?
                Or do
                you have mixed feelings about a certain teacher? We certainly had problems, and we're sure countless of
                others have as well. In order to help solve this common problem that we see every year due to the spam
                of
                polls on social media, we present to you ratenorthviewaps. </br></br>

                Rate Northview APs serves a simple but effective purpose, to help students decide which AP course is
                best
                for them. This is achieved by compiling and presenting student ratings of AP courses they have taken in
                the
                past.
                Once you visit our homepage, you can visit the about page to learn more, but let's visit the
                EncyclAPedia
                page to get started. Here you'll see a list of every AP course that Northview offers. Click any of the
                links
                to visit their respective page.</br></br>

                The first thing you'll notice is the average ratings band. This shows the average score in each category
                this course received by the past ratings. You'll also notice the course description. If you scroll down
                you
                can view each individual rating.

                In order to submit a rating, we ask that you login to a google account. The only information that we
                store
                is your email each time you submit a rating, which allows us to match each rating with the user if
                necessary.
                </br></br>
                Currently, the website is completely functional, but we are also working on new features. Once there are
                more ratings we will have graphs that allow students to rank AP courses by average rating. We are also
                working on a page that will allow students to sell their old AP review books.
                </br></br>
                Lastly, there are some people we'd like to thank. First, to our friend Adit Sachde who agreed to help
                host
                this website for us so all of you can access it,

                and second, Joanna Chen, who helped us design and plan the layout for the website.
                </br></br>
                Finally, we'd like to thank you for visiting our website and contributing to the Northview community. Go
                Jackets, and as always, it's a great day to be a titan!</br>
